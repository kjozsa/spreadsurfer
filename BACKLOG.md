- websocket order placement
- watch orders, count cancelled orders %
- auto-tune buff based on cancelled orders %
- cancel all orders on shutdown hook
- cancel only single order on wave change (eg. only buy)
- only trade above configured volume (certain # of trades)
- if can't sell / buy, check order book's highest/lowest offer
